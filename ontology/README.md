# Ontology

Initializes the ontology and provides a query interface

## Fuseki 

https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/

Will start this process after parsing the input file so that data can be loaded into it. Then Fuseki will allow queries and interaction with the ontology it has read. Currently it is minimally hooked up but the configuration is in progress
